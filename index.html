        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>You and the computer will take turns rolling a die. You can either roll or hold by pressing the corresponding buttons. You can roll as many times as you want
            and add up the points. Your turn ends when you hold or if you roll a 1. If you roll a 1, you will lose any points you gained during that round. The first
            player to reach 100 points wins!
